#### Overview
Airbnb has become a widely used platform for short-term accommodation, offering flexible and affordable options for travelers. Its popularity has grown significantly, both among guests seeking places to stay and hosts renting entire properties or spare rooms.
In this project, I analyze Airbnb listings in the city of Porto, Portugal, to identify trends in the local short-term rental market and explore the factors that influence pricing. The goal is to understand what drives listing prices and what characteristics make a property more competitive in the Porto market.

#### Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ "Adding data to the debate"), with scrapping on 21/09/2025.

#### About the Dataset
There are several different files on the site that can be downloaded and used, and after investigating, I decided to use `listings.csv` as it aggregates information from all the other files, and had all the information I need to proceed with this project.  
As the file has a big number of columns, and as to not overcumber this `ReadMe` file, I attached a file named [Column Description](Column_Description.xls) where a table is found with all the information about the columns.
