#### Overview
Airbnb has become a widely used platform for short-term accommodation, offering flexible and affordable options for travelers. Its popularity has grown significantly, both among guests seeking places to stay and hosts renting entire properties or spare rooms.
In this project, I analyze Airbnb listings in the city of Porto, Portugal, to identify trends in the local short-term rental market and explore the factors that influence pricing. The goal is to understand what drives listing prices and what characteristics make a property more competitive in the Porto market.

#### Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ "Adding data to the debate") on with data updated on the 21/09/2025.

#### About the Dataset
There are several different files on the site that can be downloaded and used, and after investigating, I decided to use `listings.csv` and `calendar.csv`.  
The first one has data on all listings and encompasses most data from the other files they have on the site as well. The file `calendar.csv` has information on the listings for the upcoming year, with availability and prices, and I intend to use that to see trends going forward.
As the files have a big number of columns, and as to not overcumber this `ReadMe` file, I attached a file named `Column Description.xls` where a table is found with all the information about the columns on both csv files.
